Ex: 'http://google.com', 'www.google.com', or just 'google.com'.\n\t\t *    This also includes a path, url parameters, or hash anchors. Ex: google.com/path/to/file?q1=1&q2=2#myAnchor\n\t\t * 6. Group that matches a protocol URL (i.e. 'http://google.com'). This is used to match protocol URLs with just a single\n\t\t *    word, like 'http://localhost', where we won't double check that the domain name has at least one '.' in it.\n\t\t * 7. A protocol-relative ('//') match for the case of a 'www.' prefixed URL. Will be an empty string if it is not a \n\t\t *    protocol-relative match.

This will produce the following code chunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r}\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\nPressing tab when inside the braces will bring up code chunk options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following R code chunk labelled `basicconsole` is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    x <- 1:10\\r\\n    y <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\\r\\n    df <- data.frame(x, y)\\r\\n    df\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code chunk input and output is then displayed as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r basicconsole}\\r\\nx <- 1:10\\r\\ny <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\\r\\ndf <- data.frame(x, y)\\r\\ndf\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plots\\r\\nImages generated by `knitr` are saved in a figures folder. However, they also appear to be represented in the HTML output using a [data URI scheme]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme). This means that you can paste the HTML into a blog post or discussion forum and you don't have to worry about finding a place to store the images; they're embedded in the HTML.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Simple plot\\r\\nHere is a basic plot using base graphics:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    plot(x)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r simpleplot}\\r\\nplot(x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to write `fig=TRUE`.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Multiple plots\\r\\nAlso, unlike traditional Sweave, you can include multiple plots in one code chunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    boxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\\r\\n    plot(x, y)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r multipleplots}\\r\\nboxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\\r\\nplot(x, y)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### `ggplot2` plot\\r\\nGgplot2 plots work well:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r ggplot2ex}\\r\\nqplot(x, y, data=df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### `lattice` plot\\r\\nAs do lattice plots:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r latticeex}\\r\\nxyplot(y~x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to print lattice plots directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n## R Code chunk features\\r\\n### Create Markdown code from R\\r\\nThe following code hides the command input (i.e., `echo=FALSE`), and outputs the content directly as code (i.e., `results=asis`, which is similar to `results=tex` in Sweave).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    cat(\\\"Here are some dot points\\\\n\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    cat(paste(\\\"* The value of y[\\\", 1:3, \\\"] is \\\", y[1:3], sep=\\\"\\\", collapse=\\\"\\\\n\\\"))\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r dotpointprint, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\ncat(\\\"Here are some dot points\\\\n\\\\n\\\")\\r\\ncat(paste(\\\"* The value of y[\\\", 1:3, \\\"] is \\\", y[1:3], sep=\\\"\\\", collapse=\\\"\\\\n\\\"))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Create Markdown table code from R\\r\\n    ```{r , results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    cat(\\\"x | y\\\", \\\"--- | ---\\\", sep=\\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    cat(apply(df, 1, function(X) paste(X, collapse=\\\" | \\\")), sep = \\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r createtable, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\ncat(\\\"x | y\\\", \\\"--- | ---\\\", sep=\\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\ncat(apply(df, 1, function(X) paste(X, collapse=\\\" | \\\")), sep = \\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control output display\\r\\nThe folllowing code supresses display of R input commands (i.e., `echo=FALSE`)\\r\\nand removes any preceding text from console output (`comment=\\\"\\\"`; the default is `comment=\\\"##\\\"`).\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r echo=FALSE, comment=\\\"\\\", echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    head(df)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r echo=FALSE, comment=\\\"\\\", echo=FALSE}\\r\\nhead(df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control figure size\\r\\nThe following is an example of a smaller figure using `fig.width` and `fig.height` options.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , fig.width=3, fig.height=3}\\r\\n    plot(x)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r smallplot, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}\\r\\nplot(x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cache analysis\\r\\nCaching analyses is straightforward.\\r\\nHere's example code.\\r\\nOn the first run on my computer, this took about 10 seconds.\\r\\nOn subsequent runs, this code was not run.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to rerun cached code chunks, just [delete the contents of the `cache` folder](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10629121/180892)\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , cache=TRUE}\\r\\n    for (i in 1:5000) {\\r\\n        lm((i+1)~i)\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic markdown functionality\\r\\nFor those not familiar with standard [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the following may be useful.\\r\\nSee the source code for how to produce such points. However, RStudio does include a Markdown quick reference button that adequatly covers this material.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Dot Points\\r\\nSimple dot points:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Point 1\\r\\n* Point 2\\r\\n* Point 3\\r\\n\\r\\nand numeric dot points:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Number 1\\r\\n2. Number 2\\r\\n3.

These shortcut keys are presented in a clear way.\\r\\n    * The incorporated extensions to Markdown, particularly formula and table support, are particularly useful.\\r\\n    * Jump-to-chunk feature facilitates navigation. It helps if your code chunks have informative names.\\r\\n    * Code completion on R code chunk options is really helpful.

The Twitter handle itself in a Twitter match. If the match is '@someTwitterUser', the handle is 'someTwitterUser'.\n\t * 4. Group that matches an email address.

The source code is available here as a gist.\\r\\nThe post may be most useful if the source code and displayed post are viewed side by side.\\r\\nIn some instances, I include a copy of the R Markdown in the displayed HTML, but most of the time I assume you are reading the source and post side by side.\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- more -->\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Getting started\\r\\nTo work with R Markdown, if necessary:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/)\\r\\n* Install the lastest version of [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download/) (at time of posting, this is 0.96)\\r\\n* Install the latest version of the `knitr` package: `install.packages(\\\"knitr\\\")`\\r\\n\\r\\nTo run the basic working example that produced this blog post:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Open R Studio, and go to File - New - R Markdown\\r\\n* If necessary install `ggplot2` and `lattice` packages: `install.packages(\\\"ggplot2\\\"); install.packages(\\\"lattice\\\") `\\r\\n* Paste in the contents of this gist (which contains the R Markdown file used to produce this post) and save the file with an `.rmd` extension\\r\\n* Click Knit HTML\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Prepare for analyses\\r\\n```{r }\\r\\nset.seed(1234)\\r\\nlibrary(ggplot2)\\r\\nlibrary(lattice)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic console output\\r\\nTo insert an R code chunk, you can type it manually or just press `Chunks - Insert chunks` or use the shortcut key. This will produce the following code chunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r}\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\nPressing tab when inside the braces will bring up code chunk options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following R code chunk labelled `basicconsole` is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    x <- 1:10\\r\\n    y <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\\r\\n    df <- data.frame(x, y)\\r\\n    df\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code chunk input and output is then displayed as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r basicconsole}\\r\\nx <- 1:10\\r\\ny <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\\r\\ndf <- data.frame(x, y)\\r\\ndf\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plots\\r\\nImages generated by `knitr` are saved in a figures folder. However, they also appear to be represented in the HTML output using a [data URI scheme]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme). This means that you can paste the HTML into a blog post or discussion forum and you don't have to worry about finding a place to store the images; they're embedded in the HTML.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Simple plot\\r\\nHere is a basic plot using base graphics:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    plot(x)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r simpleplot}\\r\\nplot(x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to write `fig=TRUE`.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Multiple plots\\r\\nAlso, unlike traditional Sweave, you can include multiple plots in one code chunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    boxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\\r\\n    plot(x, y)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r multipleplots}\\r\\nboxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\\r\\nplot(x, y)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### `ggplot2` plot\\r\\nGgplot2 plots work well:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r ggplot2ex}\\r\\nqplot(x, y, data=df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### `lattice` plot\\r\\nAs do lattice plots:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r latticeex}\\r\\nxyplot(y~x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to print lattice plots directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n## R Code chunk features\\r\\n### Create Markdown code from R\\r\\nThe following code hides the command input (i.e., `echo=FALSE`), and outputs the content directly as code (i.e., `results=asis`, which is similar to `results=tex` in Sweave).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    cat(\\\"Here are some dot points\\\\n\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    cat(paste(\\\"* The value of y[\\\", 1:3, \\\"] is \\\", y[1:3], sep=\\\"\\\", collapse=\\\"\\\\n\\\"))\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r dotpointprint, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\ncat(\\\"Here are some dot points\\\\n\\\\n\\\")\\r\\ncat(paste(\\\"* The value of y[\\\", 1:3, \\\"] is \\\", y[1:3], sep=\\\"\\\", collapse=\\\"\\\\n\\\"))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Create Markdown table code from R\\r\\n    ```{r , results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    cat(\\\"x | y\\\", \\\"--- | ---\\\", sep=\\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    cat(apply(df, 1, function(X) paste(X, collapse=\\\" | \\\")), sep = \\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r createtable, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\ncat(\\\"x | y\\\", \\\"--- | ---\\\", sep=\\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\ncat(apply(df, 1, function(X) paste(X, collapse=\\\" | \\\")), sep = \\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control output display\\r\\nThe folllowing code supresses display of R input commands (i.e., `echo=FALSE`)\\r\\nand removes any preceding text from console output (`comment=\\\"\\\"`; the default is `comment=\\\"##\\\"`).\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r echo=FALSE, comment=\\\"\\\", echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    head(df)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r echo=FALSE, comment=\\\"\\\", echo=FALSE}\\r\\nhead(df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control figure size\\r\\nThe following is an example of a smaller figure using `fig.width` and `fig.height` options.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , fig.width=3, fig.height=3}\\r\\n    plot(x)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r smallplot, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}\\r\\nplot(x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cache analysis\\r\\nCaching analyses is straightforward.\\r\\nHere's example code.\\r\\nOn the first run on my computer, this took about 10 seconds.\\r\\nOn subsequent runs, this code was not run.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to rerun cached code chunks, just [delete the contents of the `cache` folder](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10629121/180892)\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , cache=TRUE}\\r\\n    for (i in 1:5000) {\\r\\n        lm((i+1)~i)\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic markdown functionality\\r\\nFor those not familiar with standard [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the following may be useful.\\r\\nSee the source code for how to produce such points. However, RStudio does include a Markdown quick reference button that adequatly covers this material.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Dot Points\\r\\nSimple dot points:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Point 1\\r\\n* Point 2\\r\\n* Point 3\\r\\n\\r\\nand numeric dot points:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

These shortcut keys are presented in a clear way.\\r\\n    * The incorporated extensions to Markdown, particularly formula and table support, are particularly useful.\\r\\n    * Jump-to-chunk feature facilitates navigation. It helps if your code chunks have informative names.\\r\\n    * Code completion on R code chunk options is really helpful.
