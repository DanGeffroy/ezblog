Ex: 'http://google.com', 'www.google.com', or just 'google.com'.\n\t\t *    This also includes a path, url parameters, or hash anchors. Ex: google.com/path/to/file?q1=1&q2=2#myAnchor\n\t\t * 6. Group that matches a protocol URL (i.e. 'http://google.com'). This is used to match protocol URLs with just a single\n\t\t *    word, like 'http://localhost', where we won't double check that the domain name has at least one '.' in it.\n\t\t * 7. A protocol-relative ('//') match for the case of a 'www.' prefixed URL. Will be an empty string if it is not a \n\t\t *    protocol-relative match.

The source code is available here as a gist.\\r\\nThe post may be most useful if the source code and displayed post are viewed side by side.\\r\\nIn some instances, I include a copy of the R Markdown in the displayed HTML, but most of the time I assume you are reading the source and post side by side.\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- more -->\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Getting started\\r\\nTo work with R Markdown, if necessary:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/)\\r\\n* Install the lastest version of [RStudio](http://rstudio.org/download/) (at time of posting, this is 0.96)\\r\\n* Install the latest version of the `knitr` package: `install.packages(\\\"knitr\\\")`\\r\\n\\r\\nTo run the basic working example that produced this blog post:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Open R Studio, and go to File - New - R Markdown\\r\\n* If necessary install `ggplot2` and `lattice` packages: `install.packages(\\\"ggplot2\\\"); install.packages(\\\"lattice\\\") `\\r\\n* Paste in the contents of this gist (which contains the R Markdown file used to produce this post) and save the file with an `.rmd` extension\\r\\n* Click Knit HTML\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Prepare for analyses\\r\\n```{r }\\r\\nset.seed(1234)\\r\\nlibrary(ggplot2)\\r\\nlibrary(lattice)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic console output\\r\\nTo insert an R code chunk, you can type it manually or just press `Chunks - Insert chunks` or use the shortcut key. This will produce the following code chunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r}\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\nPressing tab when inside the braces will bring up code chunk options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following R code chunk labelled `basicconsole` is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    x <- 1:10\\r\\n    y <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\\r\\n    df <- data.frame(x, y)\\r\\n    df\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code chunk input and output is then displayed as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r basicconsole}\\r\\nx <- 1:10\\r\\ny <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\\r\\ndf <- data.frame(x, y)\\r\\ndf\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plots\\r\\nImages generated by `knitr` are saved in a figures folder. However, they also appear to be represented in the HTML output using a [data URI scheme]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme). This means that you can paste the HTML into a blog post or discussion forum and you don't have to worry about finding a place to store the images; they're embedded in the HTML.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Simple plot\\r\\nHere is a basic plot using base graphics:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    plot(x)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r simpleplot}\\r\\nplot(x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to write `fig=TRUE`.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Multiple plots\\r\\nAlso, unlike traditional Sweave, you can include multiple plots in one code chunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    boxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\\r\\n    plot(x, y)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r multipleplots}\\r\\nboxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\\r\\nplot(x, y)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### `ggplot2` plot\\r\\nGgplot2 plots work well:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r ggplot2ex}\\r\\nqplot(x, y, data=df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### `lattice` plot\\r\\nAs do lattice plots:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r latticeex}\\r\\nxyplot(y~x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to print lattice plots directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n## R Code chunk features\\r\\n### Create Markdown code from R\\r\\nThe following code hides the command input (i.e., `echo=FALSE`), and outputs the content directly as code (i.e., `results=asis`, which is similar to `results=tex` in Sweave).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    cat(\\\"Here are some dot points\\\\n\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    cat(paste(\\\"* The value of y[\\\", 1:3, \\\"] is \\\", y[1:3], sep=\\\"\\\", collapse=\\\"\\\\n\\\"))\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r dotpointprint, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\ncat(\\\"Here are some dot points\\\\n\\\\n\\\")\\r\\ncat(paste(\\\"* The value of y[\\\", 1:3, \\\"] is \\\", y[1:3], sep=\\\"\\\", collapse=\\\"\\\\n\\\"))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Create Markdown table code from R\\r\\n    ```{r , results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    cat(\\\"x | y\\\", \\\"--- | ---\\\", sep=\\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    cat(apply(df, 1, function(X) paste(X, collapse=\\\" | \\\")), sep = \\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r createtable, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\ncat(\\\"x | y\\\", \\\"--- | ---\\\", sep=\\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\ncat(apply(df, 1, function(X) paste(X, collapse=\\\" | \\\")), sep = \\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control output display\\r\\nThe folllowing code supresses display of R input commands (i.e., `echo=FALSE`)\\r\\nand removes any preceding text from console output (`comment=\\\"\\\"`; the default is `comment=\\\"##\\\"`).\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r echo=FALSE, comment=\\\"\\\", echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    head(df)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r echo=FALSE, comment=\\\"\\\", echo=FALSE}\\r\\nhead(df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control figure size\\r\\nThe following is an example of a smaller figure using `fig.width` and `fig.height` options.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , fig.width=3, fig.height=3}\\r\\n    plot(x)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r smallplot, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}\\r\\nplot(x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cache analysis\\r\\nCaching analyses is straightforward.\\r\\nHere's example code.\\r\\nOn the first run on my computer, this took about 10 seconds.\\r\\nOn subsequent runs, this code was not run.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to rerun cached code chunks, just [delete the contents of the `cache` folder](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10629121/180892)\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , cache=TRUE}\\r\\n    for (i in 1:5000) {\\r\\n        lm((i+1)~i)\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic markdown functionality\\r\\nFor those not familiar with standard [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the following may be useful.\\r\\nSee the source code for how to produce such points.

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\\r\\n* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\\r\\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).\\r\\n\\r\\n[Learn how to use React in your own project](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Examples\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have several examples [on the website](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Here is the first one to get you started:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nclass HelloMessage extends React.Component {\\r\\n  render() {\\r\\n    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nReactDOM.render(\\r\\n  <HelloMessage name=\\\"John\\\" />,\\r\\n  document.getElementById('container')\\r\\n);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis example will render \\\"Hello John\\\" into a container on the page.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. We recommend using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with a [React preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) to convert JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Installation\\r\\n\\r\\nReact is available as the `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It is also available on a [CDN](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#using-a-cdn).\\r\\n\\r\\nReact is flexible and can be used in a variety of projects. You can create new apps with it, but you can also gradually introduce it into an existing codebase without doing a rewrite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recommended way to install React depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:\\r\\n\\r\\n* [Trying Out React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#trying-out-react)\\r\\n* [Creating a New Application](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#creating-a-new-application)\\r\\n* [Adding React to an Existing Application](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#adding-react-to-an-existing-application)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Contributing\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.\\r\\n\\r\\n### [Code of Conduct](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct)\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to.

The Twitter handle itself in a Twitter match. If the match is '@someTwitterUser', the handle is 'someTwitterUser'.\n\t * 4. Group that matches an email address. Used to determine if the match is an email address, as well as holding the full \n\t *    address. Ex: 'me@my.com'\n\t * 5. Group that matches a URL in the input text. Ex: 'http://google.com', 'www.google.com', or just 'google.com'.\n\t *    This also includes a path, url parameters, or hash anchors. Ex: google.com/path/to/file?q1=1&q2=2#myAnchor\n\t * 6. Group that matches a protocol URL (i.e. 'http://google.com').

This will produce the following code chunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r}\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\nPressing tab when inside the braces will bring up code chunk options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following R code chunk labelled `basicconsole` is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    x <- 1:10\\r\\n    y <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\\r\\n    df <- data.frame(x, y)\\r\\n    df\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code chunk input and output is then displayed as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r basicconsole}\\r\\nx <- 1:10\\r\\ny <- round(rnorm(10, x, 1), 2)\\r\\ndf <- data.frame(x, y)\\r\\ndf\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plots\\r\\nImages generated by `knitr` are saved in a figures folder. However, they also appear to be represented in the HTML output using a [data URI scheme]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme). This means that you can paste the HTML into a blog post or discussion forum and you don't have to worry about finding a place to store the images; they're embedded in the HTML.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Simple plot\\r\\nHere is a basic plot using base graphics:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    plot(x)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r simpleplot}\\r\\nplot(x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to write `fig=TRUE`.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Multiple plots\\r\\nAlso, unlike traditional Sweave, you can include multiple plots in one code chunk:\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r }\\r\\n    boxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\\r\\n    plot(x, y)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r multipleplots}\\r\\nboxplot(1:10~rep(1:2,5))\\r\\nplot(x, y)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### `ggplot2` plot\\r\\nGgplot2 plots work well:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r ggplot2ex}\\r\\nqplot(x, y, data=df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### `lattice` plot\\r\\nAs do lattice plots:\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r latticeex}\\r\\nxyplot(y~x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that unlike traditional Sweave, there is no need to print lattice plots directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n## R Code chunk features\\r\\n### Create Markdown code from R\\r\\nThe following code hides the command input (i.e., `echo=FALSE`), and outputs the content directly as code (i.e., `results=asis`, which is similar to `results=tex` in Sweave).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    cat(\\\"Here are some dot points\\\\n\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    cat(paste(\\\"* The value of y[\\\", 1:3, \\\"] is \\\", y[1:3], sep=\\\"\\\", collapse=\\\"\\\\n\\\"))\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r dotpointprint, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\ncat(\\\"Here are some dot points\\\\n\\\\n\\\")\\r\\ncat(paste(\\\"* The value of y[\\\", 1:3, \\\"] is \\\", y[1:3], sep=\\\"\\\", collapse=\\\"\\\\n\\\"))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Create Markdown table code from R\\r\\n    ```{r , results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    cat(\\\"x | y\\\", \\\"--- | ---\\\", sep=\\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    cat(apply(df, 1, function(X) paste(X, collapse=\\\" | \\\")), sep = \\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r createtable, results='asis', echo=FALSE}\\r\\ncat(\\\"x | y\\\", \\\"--- | ---\\\", sep=\\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\ncat(apply(df, 1, function(X) paste(X, collapse=\\\" | \\\")), sep = \\\"\\\\n\\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control output display\\r\\nThe folllowing code supresses display of R input commands (i.e., `echo=FALSE`)\\r\\nand removes any preceding text from console output (`comment=\\\"\\\"`; the default is `comment=\\\"##\\\"`).\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r echo=FALSE, comment=\\\"\\\", echo=FALSE}\\r\\n    head(df)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r echo=FALSE, comment=\\\"\\\", echo=FALSE}\\r\\nhead(df)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Control figure size\\r\\nThe following is an example of a smaller figure using `fig.width` and `fig.height` options.\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , fig.width=3, fig.height=3}\\r\\n    plot(x)\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n```{r smallplot, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}\\r\\nplot(x)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cache analysis\\r\\nCaching analyses is straightforward.\\r\\nHere's example code.\\r\\nOn the first run on my computer, this took about 10 seconds.\\r\\nOn subsequent runs, this code was not run.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to rerun cached code chunks, just [delete the contents of the `cache` folder](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10629121/180892)\\r\\n\\r\\n    ```{r , cache=TRUE}\\r\\n    for (i in 1:5000) {\\r\\n        lm((i+1)~i)\\r\\n    }\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Basic markdown functionality\\r\\nFor those not familiar with standard [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the following may be useful.\\r\\nSee the source code for how to produce such points. However, RStudio does include a Markdown quick reference button that adequatly covers this material.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Dot Points\\r\\nSimple dot points:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Point 1\\r\\n* Point 2\\r\\n* Point 3\\r\\n\\r\\nand numeric dot points:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

These shortcut keys are presented in a clear way.\\r\\n    * The incorporated extensions to Markdown, particularly formula and table support, are particularly useful.\\r\\n    * Jump-to-chunk feature facilitates navigation. It helps if your code chunks have informative names.\\r\\n    * Code completion on R code chunk options is really helpful.

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\\r\\n* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\\r\\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).\\r\\n\\r\\n[Learn how to use React in your own project](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Examples\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have several examples [on the website](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Here is the first one to get you started:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nclass HelloMessage extends React.Component {\\r\\n  render() {\\r\\n    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nReactDOM.render(\\r\\n  <HelloMessage name=\\\"John\\\" />,\\r\\n  document.getElementById('container')\\r\\n);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis example will render \\\"Hello John\\\" into a container on the page.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. We recommend using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) with a [React preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) to convert JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Installation\\r\\n\\r\\nReact is available as the `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It is also available on a [CDN](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#using-a-cdn).\\r\\n\\r\\nReact is flexible and can be used in a variety of projects. You can create new apps with it, but you can also gradually introduce it into an existing codebase without doing a rewrite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recommended way to install React depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:\\r\\n\\r\\n* [Trying Out React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#trying-out-react)\\r\\n* [Creating a New Application](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#creating-a-new-application)\\r\\n* [Adding React to an Existing Application](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#adding-react-to-an-existing-application)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Contributing\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use.
